Q) What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented
in Xinu.
A)
Exponential Distribution Scheduler -
	Advantages-
	The scheduling mechanism follows Exponential Distribution, so the lower priority processes will not get starved.
	is a degree of randomization in the processing, this means that the processes will not get scheduled in the same order every time.

	Disadvantages-
	The higher priority processes will get starved. Which can be shown in the output
	A(prio = 10) = 112710, B(prio = 20) = 46707, C(prio = 30) = 23318

Linux Scheduler -
	Advantages-
	It guarentees that processes are run based on their goodness
	There is no randomization allowed, so we have predictable patterns

	Disadvantages-
	There is an overhead involved for the calculation which needs to be taken into account when we have a large number of processes in the system.

Round Robin(Xinu Scheduling) -
	Advantages-
	Higher priority processes get more cpu time
	Faster scheduling due to simple algorithm

	Disadvantages-
	Low priority processes get starved.

Q) Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.
A)
Exponential Distribution Scheduler-
We schedule the NULL process when there is no other processes in ready queue.

Linux-like Scheduler-
We will not schedule the NULL process as its goodness value is always set to 0.

Xinu Scheduling-
NULL process will not be scheduled.
